Final Project Summary and Plan

Communication and URLs
We have agreed to communicate to each other via discord. Every Wednesday after class we will meet up to do a quick catchup with each other about other parts of the project and how we are doing.  We do small summaries and checkups at 11am on Tuesdays and Thursday and discuss what parts of the project we will work on during that day.  Our Github link is here and our trello link is there .

Final Project Summary
Our final project will be a small quiz game based off Akinator, where new players for League of Legends get to answer questions. The end result will calculate the character that the user should play as. The front-end simply looks like various questions that save the answers for a sort-of calculator to look at. The back-end will have a list of character types and their uses, with one character being chosen based on the user's answers.

Team Roles and Responsibilities
Each member has equal responsibility in terms of main coding. Chuck Tranter is responsible for back-end programming. Gautam Mehla is responsible for front-end programming and Layla Nettavong is responsible for team leadership.
